This is my personal website/blog. I like to play with computers to make useful software. Interested in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Webassembly, Objective-C, Swift, Python. 

I am also interested in growing things in my garden (and using it as an excuse to build things outside), reading about history, and listening to tech podcasts.
