<p><a href="http://bendirgo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/20130517_151055.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-7 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20130517_151055.jpg?w=300" alt="20130517_151055" width="300" height="225" /></a>This is the story of how I decided to take a look into how the other side lives. I looked at the prices of a new Mac laptop then I compared it to my savings account. Realizing that I would need to increase it by a few orders of magnitude I lowered my expectations in what I should be purchasing.</p>
<p>I lowered my expectations as low as you could go and still have a laptop that you can use day-to-day. I found the sites <a href="http://www.everymac.com">everymac</a> and <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com">lowendmac</a> quite useful in making the decision of getting a PowerBook G4. Found one on eBay for $35 and all that’s wrong with it is it’s a little dinged up, and didn’t have OS X installed. No problem, another guy sells USB sticks with 10.5 on them. What system can’t boot from USB sticks?</p>
<p><a href="http://bendirgo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/20130501_095156.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-42 alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20130501_095156.jpg?w=300" alt="20130501_095156" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The PowerBook G4’s must be the only system that cannot boot from USB. Well, it can’t boot from USB without some <a href="http://www.firmworks.com/QuickRef.html" target="_blank">OpenFirmware wizardry</a>, and some unorthodox methods. So in case you are lost and have stumbled across my blog here's how I did it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://bendirgo.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/20130510_025501.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-39 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20130510_025501.jpg?w=300" alt="20130510_025501" width="419" height="314" /></a> Boot into Open Firmware on your machine with a blank USB drive plugged in. First we have to figure out where that blank USB is located in the hardware. I think we can find hardware addresses with the command</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">dev / ls</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As you can see in the picture above my hardware address for my USB was at</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">/pci@f4000000/ata-6@d/disk@0:2,\\:tbxi</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">write down that address, and set it to the boot-device with the commands,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">setenv boot-device /pci@f4000000/ata-6@d/disk@0:2,\\:tbxi</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">then you remove the blank USB disk and replace it with the USB drive that has a bootable Mac OS X operating system. And finally boot into it with</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">mac-boot</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Now I'm working from memory here, so as always Google is your friend.</p>
<p>I finally got it to boot from USB, but as it turned out the hard drive was corrupted. It was the kind of corrupted that Disk Utility would give it a pass, and then you get the OS installed it just doesn’t boot.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Back to eBay one last time, find a guy that sells PATA 2.5” drives preinstalled with everything that a budding PowerBook user would need. I double checked everything on the specs with the seller this time, and then installed the drive.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/PowerBook+G4+Aluminum+12-Inch+1-1.5+GHz+Hard+Drive+Replacement/548/1">iFixit.com</a> has a great instruction guide explaining how to go about replacing your hard drive.</p>

So well designed.[/caption]</p>

<p>Finally after a few weeks of investigation, trial and error, I have a working Apple computer.</p>
<p>I am very happy with this laptop. Sure the hardware is almost ten years old, and YouTube doesn’t stream, and I can’t install cool new apps from the Mac App store. But, god damn this keyboard is amazing, and did you see how sexy those internals are? Plus, there are plenty of determined PowerPC users out there. T<a title="So useful, use it constantly " href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/tenfourfox/" target="_blank">here are always ways to get what you need done</a>. I mean heck even Dropbox <a title="direct link" href="https://dl-web.dropbox.com/u/17/Dropbox%202.2.1.dmg" target="_blank">supports G4</a> (.dmg warning). The experience of learning about the way another system is designed was half the fun in getting this. And it gave me something to write about, and to write on, for this blog.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that in the month that I’ve used the PowerBook since I fixed it, it has not once fluctuated in performance from “day one” (Somehow the battery still has a three hour charge). But the windows laptop that I have has needed to be restored twice. Consistency is king. I hope that this machine will hold me over till I have enough to spend on one of the new <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/new-haswell-based-macbook-airs-offer-faster-graphics-all-day-battery-life/" target="_blank">MacBook Air’s</a>.</p>
