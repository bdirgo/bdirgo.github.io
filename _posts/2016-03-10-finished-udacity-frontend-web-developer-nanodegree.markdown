I have just finished the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree! It feels great to have finished ahead of schedule. I have five great sample websites under my belt.

These are links to projects I made for the degree. I loved working on each of them. Especially when I saw people use the software I wrote. Even if it was just GIFs of the graders testing my websites. XD

- [A simple resume website template][resume]
- [A frogger look-a-like][arcade-game]
- [A sample portfolio page][mobile-port], this was used to test the page load time and page speed once loaded.
- [A map of Thai resturants in downtown Sydney.][sydney] Used the Yelp API, twitter bootstrap, and Google maps to make this application.
- [An RSS feed][feed] that includes testing from the Jasmine.js framework.
