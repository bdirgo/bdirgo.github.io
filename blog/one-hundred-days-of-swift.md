# One Hundred Days of SwiftUI

*April 26, 2020*

I have decided instead of trying to cram for an interview that I don't have lined up. I want to try and create an iPhone app as a side project. I have a few ideas, and I hope they can be fleshed out into real apps. 

I tried diving into the deep end and open Xcode and see what happens. But, swift and swiftUI are just a little too different from what I have used in the past. So first I should look at some tutorials about swift and maybe look into if apps are even still a "cool" thing to do. 

After looking at Apple's tutorials, it seems like there is a gap between the "What is a string?" tutorials and more advanced tutorials that assume you have used Apple's tooling. So, I've settled on 100 days of Swift from Hacking with Swift. The rules are to post everytime you finish a tutorial, and this post is my first. 

The first two weeks are not much to write home about, I feel like I might finish them all at once tomorrow. Just as a review of how swift is different from other languages I've used. I am more excited about the later projects where instead of language features every day, you are making a project with a goal in mind.

I don't anticipate these posts being very long in the future, but I'll try and keep up a post for each day that I create something.
