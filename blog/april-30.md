![Finished iDine app](./images/iDine.png "Finished iDine app")

SwiftUI is fun :-) Finished the iDine app from Hacking with Swift, and I feel like it was a whirlwind tour of most of the new top level features in SwiftUI. It's a neat app, but I'd like to see how I will expand upon it. It feels a bit bare bones, just using the default styling makes it feel like you are in the settings app. Since one of the promises of SwiftUI is that it is easier to write apps on all the platforms, I'd like to explore how to add the other Apple platforms WatchOS, MacOS, and tvOS. I am also curious how to add more backend features, an email when you hit complete order, or a text message when the order is "being delivered". I know that isn't a SwiftUI specific thing, so I'm going to have to look at more WWDC talks and documentation to get more info on that.
