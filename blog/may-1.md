- [Created SwiftUI version of the app from yesterday](./tap-tap-unicorns.md)
- Expanding to looking at WWDC talks, great info here, excited for June online
    - SwiftUI by Example
    - WWDC talks / SwiftUI Tutorial -> Find ways to expand on the tutorials
    - Apple Books also has a good book for anyone not familiar with programming. Apple always has such good beginner tutorials.
- Finding answers to my questions about quirks that I have seen.
    - When to use a $property. The dollor sign is a binding for a state variable. So, when the property changes it will update the state, and anything else in the component that uses that variable will update.
    - sometimes its `.whatever`, sometimes its `Color.whatever`, and sometimes its `whatEver()` Still learning when to use these.
