# Day Three with Swift

*April 29, 2020*

I have kept up with the one hour a day, but have found the topic to be a bit boring when just oging over syntax. So, I'm skipping a bit and following along the SwiftUI by Example sample project just to see all this in action. It's hard to learn syntx without context. I feel like if I keep at the simple one hour a day tasks, while doing an exciting project as well, that could keep up my excitment to learn this new technology. But, if I don't have time to get to the project no big deal steadly work on the 100 days, and you'll be cooking with gas in no time.

Now something I'd like to do in app development is in the AR/ML area. That seems to be the cool new thing, and I have a few ideas of toys to build there. So, I should really be looking at Apple talks and tutorials about AR instead of looking at swift. But, this is all for fun to keep my mind busy and skills sharp for when this whole mess is over with.
